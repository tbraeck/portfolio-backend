        <h2 className='display-7'>I am a passionate Junior FullStack Developer who has many years of experience in education to bolster my growing experience and skills in software engineering. During my years as an educator I have built my management skills, learned to expand my interpersonal and small/ large group facilitator skills, have become more organized and efficient with materials, ideas, and time, and have also become a more patient, caring, and collaborative human along the way.

Some of my achievements recently are: graduating from Flatiron School with my FullStack Engineering Certification and running a small online business. I am open to any industry or organization that can use my diversified skills and experience in a positive, forward-thinking fashion. 

Technical Skills: Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Backend Engineering, Frontend Engineering, FullStack Engineering</h2>
